/******************************************************************************
From device to device, the I2C communication protocol may vary,
in the example below, the protocol uses repeated start to read data from or
write to the device:
For master read: the sequence is: STA,Addr(W),offset,RE-STA,Addr(r),data...STO
for master write: the sequence is: STA,Addr(W),offset,RE-STA,Addr(w),data...STO
Thus, in state 8, the address is always WRITE. in state 10, the address could
be READ or WRITE depending on the I2C command.
********************************************************************************
LOGi FAMILY USAGE:
DESCRIPOTION: I2C will receive commands that can be processed the change the operation of hte LPC Chip.
Packets: 	[1byte]  	[1byte]		[1byte]
packet	: 	[cmd1] 		[data1]		 [data2]	.... [data7] = 8 bytes total packet

The commands can be processed directly in the interrupt if very short time is needed.
or a task flag can be set to process other more latent tasks such as fpga config initiate.
1) To add a command, add a #define and invrement the command number.
2) check for the command in the switch statement in the i2c irq.  the command can be direclty
	processed (if very quick), or set a task that be processed in order not to block the irq or program.
3) If needed add a task define, set the defined task to be processed in "I2C_process_task"
